This game utilizes $1 algorithm to recognize gestures and compare them to target figure. Player is given a random shape from pre-made templates and has to draw it using touch/mouse input. Received gesture is then rescaled and compared to target. Comparison is affected by rotation, so player has to draw shapes at same angle as given.
Touch control relies on mouse simulation.
New gestures can be added from within the game.
